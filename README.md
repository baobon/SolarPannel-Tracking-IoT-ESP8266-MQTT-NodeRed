# SolarPanel_Tracking_IoT

The Solar Panel Tracking project is designed to track the sun's direction and optimize solar panel efficiency. The project utilizes a Dual USB Solar Charge Controller LCD 10A, an LCD1602 display to show values, a temperature and humidity sensor, a relay with button or node-red MQTT, and a buzzer. Additionally, the system reads DC voltage, current, and power from the solar panel and sends data to MQTT for data visualization in charts.

The project's main function is to detect the sun's direction and adjust the solar panel accordingly, ensuring that it is always facing the sun for maximum efficiency. The LCD display provides real-time values, while the temperature and humidity sensor monitors the environment's conditions. The relay and buzzer are used for alerts and control.
